# Extensions

This package contains extension functions for the classes defined in `data.core` - particularly
those in `data.core.room.entities`.

Those class definitions should remain minimal, with only the functionality required to retrieve
them from API and/or persist them locally.

Here we can define anything else that is useful for those classes.
